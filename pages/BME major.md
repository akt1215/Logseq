- ## Advantage
- It gives me a lot of knowledge in different fields which probably will help me  a lot when pursuing Ph.D
- Small department
- I can use 5 of the tech electives on whatever tech course I want which means I can also learn EE/ CE material with it
-
- ## Disadvantage
- I have to take another semester of Chem, and then a year of Bio
- The 3rd year will basically just be BME courses and they are not really focused on BCI
- If I wanted to work in industry after graduation, it doesn't help me prepare for it really
- **So many required courses**
	- Average of 17.58
	- After subtracting 3 of the tech electives and 1 (because I'm taking it already), it is still 15.6
