- ## Advantage
- Less required courses than EE
	- Average of 16.25
- It still gives me a lot of exposure to EE material
- I can still also take BCI lab
-
- ## Disadvantage
- Still more required courses than CS
- There are some courses that doesn't isn't much related to my interest (ex. OS, SoC Platforms)
