- ## Advantage
- This is something I haven't really done before, thus I get to learn new stuff
- This is the skills that I really need for BCI (especially invasive)
-
- ## Disadvantage
- Since I haven't really done this topic, I will be very behind
- IDK how much it'll be useful if I want to pursue the non-invasive side of BCI
- Decent number of courses I have to take in the next 3 years
	- Average of 16.7 credits without any extra courses
