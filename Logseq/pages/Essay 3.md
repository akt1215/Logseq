## Hook
	- AI art vs human art
		- What is the difference between the human art and AI art
		- Both human and AI learns and what they produce is based on what they learned
		- In this way, nothing is original in the strong definition of “original”
		- However, we value human art a lot more than AI art
			- Find a source to support that society value human art than AI

			- We consider human art original, and AI art is copy
			  background-color:: pink
		- So what is the difference between human and AI art
			- ⇒ the story
- ## What is “Story”
	- Story in this context means, for example, the production process or the backstory of the production, such as the struggle, emotion, and more
	- There is a research that suggest that people's purchase can be influenced by the backstory of the product.

	- For example, I think you have heard of people not buying a certain product because its production process includes ethical issues
		- This suggests that we value not just the quality of the product holds, but also what the product is including the production process, or in other words, story
	- This is why we often value human art over AI art because we can relate to the story of the human creation, but not really to the AI creatiion.
		- But AI art can hold a special value to someone, for example, for the person who built the AI model, as it is something that he made, meaning he knows the backstory of the production
	- This is why we often value what we made, because we feel a stronger emotional attachment to it since we know the backstory of it.
	- However, it would mean nothing to others if they don't know the backstory
	- And I consider anything with a backstory to it, an art
		- In this way, anything can be an art
		- This sounds wrong, but it is
		- Some one finds a value in a modern art which, to other's eyes, just might seem to be a random assembly of weird stuff.
		- So whether or not the person considers something an art, is up to them, in a sense that whether they know the backstory or not
- ## How does it relate to the movie
	- When we first watched the movie, our general 感想 was that the movie seems to make no sense and that the movie is bad and even questioned its value as an art
	- I was thinking like "how could this be allowed to call itself a movie, if it just seems to be like a compile of clips that do not make sense
	- We thought in this way because we couldn't find a "story"
		- There was no clear plot line, and there are clearly some inconsistencies in characters which made us hard to grasp the "story"
	- **However** if (in a sense, IT IS) it was the intention of the director
		- The director intentionally make the audience hard to find the "story"
		- So it is not just the movie itself, but also the experience of the movie that creates the "story"
	- So the with the experience of the audience, for the first time the movie becomes an art
	-
