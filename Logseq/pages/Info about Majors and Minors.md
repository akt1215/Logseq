# Plan 1 -- [[BME major]] , [[EE minor]]
	- Good combination because out of 7 BME technical requirements, I can take 5 technical courses outside of BME major
	- For those, I can take the EE minor required courses which have 4--5
	- So really, I only have to take 1 extra course in order to do minor
	-
- # Plan 2 -- [[EE major]] , [[BME minor]]
	- I don't know if the required technical courses are siliar to BME where I can take from other department
	- Otherwise, I would be taking extra courses which may restrict my schedule
- # Plan 3 -- [[CE major]]
- # Plan 4 -- [[CS major]]
-
- # Plan 5 -- * major, [[Econ minor]]
	- This does not really work because all the econ classes I have to take, except for the electives, are extra courses just for econ minor
	- I probably do not want to do it
- # Plan 6 -- BME and EE double major
	- Technically speaking, it is possible
	- But realistically, it is not feasible because I have to take their technical required courses separately

- # Conversation with Ph.D students
	- Christina
		- NO BME
		- DO EE or MECH E
	- Aaron
		- Do what I want to do
		- At the end of the day, the major does not affect too much on the Ph.D application
