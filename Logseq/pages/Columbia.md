	- Biomedical Engineering
		- so many stupid required courses (aka. Chem) but りきさん told me that Professor Nima was saying that it is great to have a biomedical engineering major people so it's probably nice to keep going as a biomedical engineering major
	- CS
		- I don't have to take any more chem if I am a CS major which is great, but I think there are other required courses that wouldn't be much enjoyable, but I might be wrong
		- It is also great for jobs if I want to get a job after undergraduate rather than going to PhD
	- MechE
		- I don't know how MechE would get me to BCI, but it sounds like a cool major.
		- If I do MechE, it would probably be more of the physical aspect of BCI rather than language processing
	- EE
		- It seems like a lot of the people in the DL class are from EE major
	- CE
		- In between EE and CS
		- It might be good since I can learn both software and hardware aspect
		- May have a lot of requirements and may not have enough time to take BCI course or other interesting course
