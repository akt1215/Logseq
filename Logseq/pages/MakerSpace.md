# Keyboard and peripherals
- Built Totem Keyboard
- Built laptop stand
-
- # Shelf
- I haven't completed but I am trying to build a shelf for my room using 3D printer
- ## Ideas
	- Circular/ Rectangular poles and Circular supports
		- Pros:
			- I dot't have to worry about the orientation of the support
		- Cons:
			- It might be hard to perfectly make the foot vertical because it is hard to tell the orientation of the pole
	- Rectangular poles and supports
		- Pros:
			- It is easier to tell if the pole is aligned straight or not
		- Cons:
			- It might be harder to set the support in the exactly right orientation
	- Instead of making a thread, maybe I can make a mold in the pole where a part of the support can go in
		-
		- Pros:
			- I can just slide back and forth so it is a lot easier to modular
		- Cons:
			- Strength issue
			- The size of the pole has to be increased (or maybe not)
